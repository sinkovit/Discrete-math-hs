Although modern cryptography uses much more complex techniques, this illustrates some of the key statistical issues such as the use of word and letter frequencies."

      "distant inequalities of the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "this appearance excited our unqualified wonder. we were, as we believed,\n",

      "it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. shut in, however, by\n",

      "\n",
      "about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\n",

      "he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a european.  when i appeared on deck the\n",

      "good god!  margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\n",
      "his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  his limbs were\n",
      "nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\n",
      "suffering.  i never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  we attempted\n",
      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\n",
      "air he fainted.  we accordingly brought him back to the deck and\n",
      "restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\n",
      "swallow a small quantity.  as soon as he showed signs of life we\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\n",
      "kitchen stove.  by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  when he\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  i never saw a more\n",
      "interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled.  but he\n",

      "his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\n",

      "with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. he then took\n",
      "a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\n",
      "its elementary terms. after having made a few preparatory experiments, he\n",

      "accomplished.  i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead\n",

      "this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied\n",

      "i enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\n",

      "the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\n",

      "we passed a considerable period at oxford, rambling among its environs\n",

      "were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\n",

      "everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\n",
      "distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\n",

      "manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix.  the latter name\n",

      "from derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\n",

      "northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\n",
      "rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  here also we\n",
      "made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\n",
      "happiness.  the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than\n",
      "mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\n",
      "in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\n",
      "imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\n",
      "inferiors.  “i could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\n",

      "when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\n",
      "that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\n",
      "engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n",

      "to travel on.  for my own part i was not sorry.  i had now neglected my\n",
      "promise for some time, and i feared the effects of the dæmon’s\n",
      "disappointment.  he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance\n",

      "miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i\n",
      "saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father, i hardly dared to\n",
      "read and ascertain my fate.  sometimes i thought that the fiend\n",
      "followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\n",
      "when these thoughts possessed me, i would not quit henry for a moment,\n",
      "but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\n",
      "his destroyer.  i felt as if i had committed some great crime, the\n",
      "consciousness of which haunted me.  i was guiltless, but i had indeed\n",

      "to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts, but i did not\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  i had resolved in\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made\n",

      "between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then, putting my\n",

      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. the sky became clouded, but\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n",
      "rising. but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n",
      "that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid the\n",

      "\n",
      "i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i\n",

      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n",
      "which i had embarked. i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n",
      "that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n",
      "water. thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. i\n",
      "confess that i felt a few sensations of terror. i had no compass with me\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. i might be driven into the\n",
      "wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. i had already\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n",
      "my other sufferings. i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. “fiend,” i exclaimed, “your\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!” i thought of elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie so\n",

      "some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n",
      "free from breakers.  but these gave place to a heavy swell; i felt sick\n",

      "\n",
      "how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! i constructed another sail with a\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had a\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as i approached nearer i easily perceived\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. i saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. i\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i was in a state of\n",
      "extreme debility, i resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n",
      "where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money with\n",
      "me. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good\n",

      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot.  they seemed much surprised at my\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. as it was, i merely remarked that they\n",
      "spoke english, and i therefore addressed them in that language.  “my\n",

      "stranger, and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions.  “why do you answer me so\n",

      "no one replied. i then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “come, sir, you must\n",

      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "about half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, daniel nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n",
      "for port. it was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n",
      "two miles below. he walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. as he was proceeding\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n",

      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. their first supposition was that it was the\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. they instantly carried it to the cottage\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n",
      "to life. it appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n",
      "years of age. he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n",
      "support.  the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "the son confirmed his father’s account, but when daniel nugent was\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n",

      "\n",
      "another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n",

      "was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed.\n",
      "besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know\n",

      "effect the sight of it would produce upon me. this idea was probably\n",
      "suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the\n",
      "murder had been described. i was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\n",
      "and several other persons, to the inn. i could not help being struck by the\n",
      "strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\n",
      "knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had\n",
      "inhabited about the time that the body had been found, i was perfectly\n",
      "tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. how\n",
      "can i describe my sensations on beholding it? i feel yet parched with\n",
      "horror, nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\n",
      "agony. the examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry\n",
      "clerval stretched before me. i gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\n",
      "the body, i exclaimed, “have my murderous machinations deprived you\n",
      "also, my dearest henry, of life? two i have already destroyed; other\n",
      "victims await their destiny; but you, clerval, my friend, my\n",
      "benefactor—”\n",
      "\n",
      "the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured, and\n",
      "i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "a fever succeeded to this. i lay for two months on the point of death; my\n",
      "ravings, as i afterwards heard, were frightful; i called myself the\n",
      "murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval. sometimes i entreated my\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was\n",
      "tormented; and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. fortunately, as i spoke\n",
      "my native language, mr. kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n",

      "\n",
      "why did i not die? more miserable than man ever was before, why did i not\n",

      "made that i could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\n",
      "the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n",
      "\n",
      "but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\n",
      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n",
      "it was morning, i remember, when i thus awoke to understanding; i had\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when i looked around\n",
      "and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i\n",
      "was, all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n",
      "me.  she was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n",
      "that class.  the lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. her\n",
      "tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in english,\n",
      "and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“are you better now, sir?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "i replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “i believe i am;\n",
      "but if it be all true, if indeed i did not dream, i am sorry that i am\n",
      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“for that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, i believe that it were better for you if you\n",
      "were dead, for i fancy it will go hard with you!  however, that’s none\n",
      "of my business; i am sent to nurse you and get you well; i do my duty\n",
      "with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n",
      "speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but i felt\n",
      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  the whole series\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n",
      "of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "as the images that floated before me became more distinct, i grew\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  the\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n",
      "second.  who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "these were my first reflections, but i soon learned that mr. kirwin had\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness.  he had caused the best room in the prison\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse.  it is true, he seldom came to\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer.  he came, therefore, sometimes to see\n",
      "that i was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n",
      "intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "one day, while i was gradually recovering, i was seated in a chair, my eyes\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. i was overcome by gloom\n",
      "and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. at one time i\n",
      "considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor justine had been. such were my\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr. kirwin entered.\n",
      "his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\n",
      "mine and addressed me in french,\n",
      "\n",
      "“i fear that this place is very shocking to you; can i do anything to\n",
      "make you more comfortable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\n",
      "earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\n",
      "one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  but you will, i\n",
      "hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\n",
      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that is my least concern; i am, by a course of strange events, become\n",
      "the most miserable of mortals.  persecuted and tortured as i am and\n",
      "have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred.  you were thrown, by some\n",
      "surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\n",
      "seized immediately, and charged with murder.  the first sight that was\n",
      "presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\n",
      "unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\n",
      "your path.”\n",
      "\n",
      "as mr. kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation i endured on\n",
      "this retrospect of my sufferings, i also felt considerable surprise at\n",
      "the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  i suppose some\n",
      "astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for mr. kirwin hastened\n",
      "to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\n",
      "your person were brought me, and i examined them that i might discover some\n",
      "trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\n",
      "and illness. i found several letters, and, among others, one which i\n",
      "discovered from its commencement to be from your father. i instantly wrote\n",
      "to geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\n",
      "but you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\n",
      "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder i am\n",
      "now to lament?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“your family is perfectly well,” said mr. kirwin with\n",
      "gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\n",
      "instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\n",
      "misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for\n",
      "me to comply with his hellish desires.  i put my hand before my eyes,\n",
      "and cried out in agony,\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh! take him away! i cannot see him; for god’s sake, do not\n",
      "let him enter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  he could not help\n",
      "regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\n",
      "rather a severe tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“i should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\n",
      "would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“my father!” cried i, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\n",
      "from anguish to pleasure.  “is my father indeed come?  how kind, how\n",
      "very kind!  but where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\n",
      "thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\n",
      "and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.  he rose and\n",
      "quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\n",
      "arrival of my father. i stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "“are you then safe—and elizabeth—and ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\n",
      "dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\n",
      "desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\n",
      "cheerfulness. “what a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\n",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\n",
      "of the room. “you travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\n",
      "to pursue you. and poor clerval—”\n",
      "\n",
      "the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\n",
      "great to be endured in my weak state; i shed tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“alas! yes, my father,” replied i; “some destiny of the\n",
      "most horrible kind hangs over me, and i must live to fulfil it, or surely i\n",
      "should have died on the coffin of henry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "we were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\n",
      "precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\n",
      "could ensure tranquillity.  mr. kirwin came in and insisted that my\n",
      "strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  but the\n",
      "appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and i\n",
      "gradually recovered my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "as my sickness quitted me, i was absorbed by a gloomy and black\n",
      "melancholy that nothing could dissipate.  the image of clerval was\n",
      "for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.  more than once the agitation\n",
      "into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\n",
      "relapse.  alas!  why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\n",
      "life?  it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny, which is now\n",
      "drawing to a close.  soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\n",
      "throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\n",
      "me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, i shall also\n",
      "sink to rest.  then the appearance of death was distant, although the\n",
      "wish was ever present to my thoughts; and i often sat for hours\n",
      "motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\n",
      "might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "the season of the assizes approached.  i had already been three months\n",
      "in prison, and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a\n",
      "relapse, i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\n",
      "town where the court was held.  mr. kirwin charged himself with every\n",
      "care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  i was spared\n",
      "the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\n",
      "brought before the court that decides on life and death.  the grand\n",
      "jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that i was on the orkney\n",
      "islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\n",
      "after my removal i was liberated from prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\n",
      "criminal charge, that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh\n",
      "atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.  i did not\n",
      "participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\n",
      "palace were alike hateful.  the cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\n",
      "although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, i\n",
      "saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\n",
      "no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.  sometimes\n",
      "they were the expressive eyes of henry, languishing in death, the dark\n",
      "orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\n",
      "them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as i\n",
      "first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt.\n",
      "\n",
      "my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.  he talked\n",
      "of geneva, which i should soon visit, of elizabeth and ernest; but\n",
      "these words only drew deep groans from me.  sometimes, indeed, i felt a\n",
      "wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\n",
      "cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\n",
      "the blue lake and rapid rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\n",
      "childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\n",
      "prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\n",
      "these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\n",
      "despair.  at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the\n",
      "existence i loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\n",
      "to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\n",
      "triumphed over my selfish despair.  it was necessary that i should\n",

      "i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\n",
      "chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\n",
      "blast me by his presence, i might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\n",
      "the existence of the monstrous image which  i had endued with the\n",
      "mockery of a soul still more monstrous.  my father still desired to\n",
      "delay our departure, fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a\n",
      "journey, for i was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.  my\n",
      "strength was gone.  i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\n",
      "preyed upon my wasted frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "still, as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\n",
      "my father thought it best to yield. we took our passage on board a vessel\n",
      "bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores.\n",
      "it was midnight. i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\n",
      "the dashing of the waves. i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my\n",
      "sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should\n",
      "soon see geneva. the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\n",
      "yet the vessel in which i was, the wind that blew me from the detested\n",
      "shore of ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\n",

      "he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a european.  when i appeared on deck the\n",

      "good god!  margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\n",

      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\n",
      "air he fainted.  we accordingly brought him back to the deck and\n",

      "swallow a small quantity.  as soon as he showed signs of life we\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\n",
      "kitchen stove.  by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  when he\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  i never saw a more\n",
      "interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled.  but he\n",

      "his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\n",

      "beat rapidly.  i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\n",

      "before my eyes, and i raved incessantly concerning him.  doubtless my\n",
      "words surprised henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\n",
      "of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which i\n",
      "continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\n",
      "indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\n",
      "\n",
      "by very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\n",
      "grieved my friend, i recovered.  i remember the first time i became\n",
      "capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, i\n",
      "perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\n",
      "buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  it was\n",
      "a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\n",
      "convalescence.  i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\n",

      "distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n",
      "lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n",
      "more refined and moral.  a servant in geneva does not mean the same\n",

      "our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n",

      "“you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\n",
      "your return to us; and i was at first tempted to write only a few\n",
      "lines, merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you.  but\n",
      "that would be a cruel kindness, and i dare not do it.  what would be\n",
      "your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\n",
      "behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  and how, victor, can\n",
      "i relate our misfortune?  absence cannot have rendered you callous to\n",
      "our joys and griefs; and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent\n",
      "son?  i wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but i know it is\n",

      "returning; and then we discovered that william and ernest, who had gone\n",
      "on before, were not to be found.  we accordingly rested on a seat until\n",
      "they should return.  presently ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\n",
      "his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that william\n",

      "afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n",

      "lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\n",
      "elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.  about five in the morning i\n",
      "discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before i had seen blooming and\n",

      "\n",

      "was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.  we\n",

      "how altered every thing might be during that time! one sudden and\n",

      "more gloomily. the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and i\n",
      "foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human\n",
      "beings. alas! i prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\n",
      "circumstance, that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded, i did not\n",
      "conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva; the gates\n",
      "of the town were already shut; and i was obliged to pass the night at\n",
      "secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. the sky\n",
      "was serene; and, as i was unable to rest, i resolved to visit the spot\n",
      "where my poor william had been murdered. as i could not pass through the\n",
      "town, i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais.\n",
      "during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont\n",
      "blanc in the most beautiful figures. the storm appeared to approach\n",
      "rapidly, and, on landing, i ascended a low hill, that i might observe its\n",
      "progress. it advanced; the heavens were clouded, and i soon felt the rain\n",
      "coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "i quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\n",
      "increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\n",
      "over my head.  it was echoed from salêve, the juras, and the alps of\n",
      "savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\n",
      "lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\n",
      "every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\n",
      "from the preceding flash.  the storm, as is often the case in\n",
      "switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. the\n",
      "most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\n",
      "lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of\n",
      "copêt. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes; and another\n",
      "darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle, a peaked mountain to the\n",
      "east of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "while i watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, i wandered on with\n",
      "a hasty step. this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; i clasped my\n",
      "hands, and exclaimed aloud, “william, dear angel! this is thy\n",
      "funeral, this thy dirge!” as i said these words, i perceived in the\n",
      "gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; i stood\n",
      "fixed, gazing intently: i could not be mistaken. a flash of lightning\n",
      "illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\n",
      "gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\n",
      "to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n",
      "dæmon, to whom i had given life. what did he there? could he be (i\n",
      "shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? no sooner did that\n",
      "idea cross my imagination, than i became convinced of its truth; my teeth\n",
      "chattered, and i was forced to lean against a tree for support. the figure\n",
      "passed me quickly, and i lost it in the gloom. nothing in human shape could\n",
      "have destroyed the fair child. _he_ was the murderer! i could not\n",
      "doubt it. the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\n",
      "fact. i thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\n",
      "another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\n",
      "perpendicular ascent of mont salêve, a hill that bounds plainpalais on the\n",
      "south. he soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "i remained motionless.  the thunder ceased; but the rain still\n",
      "continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  i\n",
      "revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget:\n",
      "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\n",
      "the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  two years had\n",
      "now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\n",
      "was this his first crime?  alas!  i had turned loose into the world a\n",
      "depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\n",
      "murdered my brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the\n",
      "night, which i spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  but i did not\n",
      "feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\n",
      "scenes of evil and despair.  i considered the being whom i had cast\n",
      "among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\n",
      "of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\n",
      "of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\n",
      "to destroy all that was dear to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "day dawned; and i directed my steps towards the town.  the gates were\n",
      "open, and i hastened to my father’s house.  my first thought was to\n",
      "discover what i knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\n",
      "made.  but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell. a\n",
      "being whom i myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\n",
      "midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  i\n",
      "remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at\n",
      "the time that i dated my creation, and which would give an air of\n",
      "delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  i well knew that\n",
      "if any other had communicated such a relation to me, i should have\n",
      "looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  besides, the strange nature\n",
      "of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if i were so far credited\n",
      "as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  and then of what use would\n",
      "be pursuit?  who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\n",
      "overhanging sides of mont salêve?  these reflections determined me, and\n",
      "i resolved to remain silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was about five in the morning when i entered my father’s house.  i\n",
      "told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\n",
      "to attend their usual hour of rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and i\n",
      "stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my\n",
      "departure for ingolstadt. beloved and venerable parent! he still remained\n",
      "to me. i gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\n",
      "mantel-piece. it was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\n",
      "desire, and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\n",
      "by the coffin of her dead father. her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\n",
      "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n",
      "sentiment of pity. below this picture was a miniature of william; and my\n",
      "tears flowed when i looked upon it. while i was thus engaged, ernest\n",
      "entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n",
      "“welcome, my dearest victor,” said he. “ah! i wish you\n",
      "had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\n",
      "delighted. you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\n",
      "alleviate; yet your presence will, i hope, revive our father, who seems\n",
      "sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\n",
      "elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—poor\n",
      "william! he was our darling and our pride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\n",
      "agony crept over my frame.  before, i had only imagined the\n",
      "wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\n",
      "a not less terrible, disaster.  i tried to calm ernest; i enquired more\n",
      "minutely concerning my father, and here i named my cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“she most of all,” said ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n",
      "herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\n",
      "very wretched.  but since the murderer has been discovered—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“the murderer discovered!  good god! how can that be? who could attempt\n",
      "to pursue him?  it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\n",
      "winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  i saw him too; he\n",
      "was free last night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\n",
      "wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.  no\n",
      "one would believe it at first; and even now elizabeth will not be\n",
      "convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  indeed, who would credit\n",
      "that justine moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\n",
      "could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“justine moritz!  poor, poor girl, is she the accused?  but it is\n",
      "wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\n",
      "almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\n",
      "confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, i fear,\n",
      "leaves no hope for doubt.  but she will be tried today, and you will\n",
      "then hear all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "he then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor william\n",
      "had been discovered, justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\n",
      "bed for several days.  during this interval, one of the servants,\n",
      "happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\n",
      "murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\n",
      "had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  the servant\n",
      "instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\n",
      "any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\n",
      "justine was apprehended.  on being charged with the fact, the poor girl\n",
      "confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied\n",
      "earnestly, “you are all mistaken; i know the murderer.  justine, poor,\n",
      "good justine, is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "at that instant my father entered.  i saw unhappiness deeply impressed\n",
      "on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\n",
      "after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\n",
      "some other topic than that of our disaster, had not ernest exclaimed,\n",
      "“good god, papa!  victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\n",
      "poor william.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“we do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed i had\n",
      "rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\n",
      "depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“my dear father, you are mistaken; justine is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“if she is, god forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  she is to be\n",
      "tried today, and i hope, i sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "this speech calmed me.  i was firmly convinced in my own mind that\n",
      "justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  i\n",
      "had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\n",
      "brought forward strong enough to convict her.  my tale was not one to\n",
      "announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\n",
      "madness by the vulgar.  did any one indeed exist, except i, the\n",
      "creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\n",
      "existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\n",
      "which i had let loose upon the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "we were soon joined by elizabeth.  time had altered her since i last\n",
      "beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\n",
      "her childish years.  there was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\n",
      "it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\n",
      "she welcomed me with the greatest affection.  “your arrival, my dear\n",
      "cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.  you perhaps will find some\n",
      "means to justify my poor guiltless justine.  alas! who is safe, if she\n",
      "be convicted of crime?  i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do\n",
      "upon my own.  our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\n",
      "lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom i sincerely\n",
      "love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  if she is condemned, i\n",
      "never shall know joy more.  but she will not, i am sure she will not;\n",
      "and then i shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\n",
      "william.”\n",
      "\n",

      "out of the room, but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my\n",
      "work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and i accordingly\n",
      "put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\n",
      "up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\n",
      "meantime i sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\n",

      "\n",
      "nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\n",
      "in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.  i had\n",
      "before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\n",
      "whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but i now felt as if a film\n",
      "had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw\n",
      "clearly.  the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\n",
      "to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts, but i did not\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  i had resolved in\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made\n",
      "would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and i\n",
      "banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then, putting my\n",
      "basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\n",
      "the scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\n",
      "but i sailed away from them. i felt as if i was about the commission of a\n",
      "dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\n",
      "fellow creatures. at one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\n",
      "suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and i took advantage of the moment of\n",
      "darkness and cast my basket into the sea; i listened to the gurgling sound\n",
      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. the sky became clouded, but\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n",
      "rising. but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n",
      "that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid the\n",
      "moon, everything was obscure, and i heard only the sound of the boat as its\n",
      "keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time i\n",
      "slept soundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i\n",
      "found that the sun had already mounted considerably. the wind was high, and\n",
      "the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. i found\n",
      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n",
      "which i had embarked. i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n",
      "that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n",
      "water. thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. i\n",
      "confess that i felt a few sensations of terror. i had no compass with me\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. i might be driven into the\n",
      "wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. i had already\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n",
      "my other sufferings. i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. “fiend,” i exclaimed, “your\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!” i thought of elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie so\n",
      "despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\n",
      "closing before me for ever, i shudder to reflect on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n",
      "free from breakers.  but these gave place to a heavy swell; i felt sick\n",
      "and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly i saw a line of high\n",
      "land towards the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "almost spent, as i was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured\n",
      "for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\n",
      "warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! i constructed another sail with a\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had a\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as i approached nearer i easily perceived\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. i saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. i\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i was in a state of\n",
      "extreme debility, i resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n",
      "where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money with\n",
      "me. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good\n",
      "harbour, which i entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot.  they seemed much surprised at my\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. as it was, i merely remarked that they\n",
      "spoke english, and i therefore addressed them in that language.  “my\n",
      "good friends,” said i, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\n",
      "this town and inform me where i am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n",

      "but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, i promise you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\n",
      "stranger, and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions.  “why do you answer me so\n",
      "roughly?”  i replied.  “surely it is not the custom of englishmen to\n",
      "receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\n",
      "english may be, but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "while this strange dialogue continued, i perceived the crowd rapidly\n",
      "increase. their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\n",
      "annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. i inquired the way to the inn, but\n",
      "no one replied. i then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “come, sir, you must\n",
      "follow me to mr. kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“who is mr. kirwin?  why am i to give an account of myself?  is not\n",

      "\n",
      "“ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.  mr. kirwin is a magistrate,\n",

      "found murdered here last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "this answer startled me, but i presently recovered myself. i was innocent;\n",
      "that could easily be proved; accordingly i followed my conductor in silence\n",
      "and was led to one of the best houses in the town. i was ready to sink from\n",
      "fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, i thought it politic\n",
      "to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\n",
      "apprehension or conscious guilt. little did i then expect the calamity that\n",
      "was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\n",
      "all fear of ignominy or death.\n",

      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "about half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, daniel nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n",
      "for port. it was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n",
      "two miles below. he walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. as he was proceeding\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n",

      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. their first supposition was that it was the\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. they instantly carried it to the cottage\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n",
      "to life. it appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n",
      "years of age. he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n",
      "support.  the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "the son confirmed his father’s account, but when daniel nugent was\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n",

      "only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\n",
      "was afterwards found.\n",
      "\n",
      "another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n",

      "quite gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\n",
      "that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\n",
      "was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed.\n",
      "besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know\n",
      "the shore, i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\n",
      "of the town of —— from the place where i had deposited the corpse.\n",

      "suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the\n",

      "agony. the examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry\n",

      "i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "a fever succeeded to this. i lay for two months on the point of death; my\n",
      "ravings, as i afterwards heard, were frightful; i called myself the\n",
      "murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval. sometimes i entreated my\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was\n",
      "tormented; and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. fortunately, as i spoke\n",
      "my native language, mr. kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n",
      "bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "why did i not die? more miserable than man ever was before, why did i not\n",

      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n",
      "it was morning, i remember, when i thus awoke to understanding; i had\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when i looked around\n",
      "and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i\n",
      "was, all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n",
      "me.  she was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n",
      "that class.  the lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. her\n",

      "\n",
      "“are you better now, sir?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "i replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “i believe i am;\n",

      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“for that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, i believe that it were better for you if you\n",

      "\n",
      "i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n",
      "speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but i felt\n",
      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  the whole series\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n",
      "of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "as the images that floated before me became more distinct, i grew\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  the\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n",
      "second.  who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "these were my first reflections, but i soon learned that mr. kirwin had\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness.  he had caused the best room in the prison\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse.  it is true, he seldom came to\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer.  he came, therefore, sometimes to see\n",
      "that i was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n",
      "intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "one day, while i was gradually recovering, i was seated in a chair, my eyes\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. i was overcome by gloom\n",
      "and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. at one time i\n",
      "considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor justine had been. such were my\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr. kirwin entered.\n",

      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that is my least concern; i am, by a course of strange events, become\n",

      "have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred.  you were thrown, by some\n",

      "seized immediately, and charged with murder.  the first sight that was\n",

      "misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for\n",

    "Our experience with 'the' drives home the limitations of relying purely on letter frequency. Too many of the letters have frequencies that are nearly indistiguishable. The situation is complicated by the choice of text used to derive the letter frequencies since there may be subtle changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to letter frequencies and word frequencies, we can make use of the relative frequencies with which letters appear as the first letter in a word. Although this doesn't give us much progress on cracking our code, the letters z, q, x and j present an interesting case. All four of these appear with low frequencies (0.074%, 0.095%, 0.150% and 0.153% respectively) and there's a significant gap between the frequency of j and that of the k (0.772%), the next letter in order of frequency. As a result, these four letters normally occupy the first four spots but with the order often scrambled, especially for z/q and x/j. They can be distinguished though by their frequency as first letter in a word."

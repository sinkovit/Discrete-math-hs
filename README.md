# Discrete-math-hs

This repo contains a collection of Python notebooks that illustrate concepts in discrete math. They are not intended to teach discrete math, but rather supplement and extend what is done in the classroom. For example, many introductory discrete math classes incorporate exercises that involve rolling dice, flipping coins, dealing hands of cards, counting letters in a body of text or finding Eulerian paths in graphs. While these hands-on exercises are extremely useful, they are limited by the number of rolls, flips and deals that can be executed, size of the text that can be analyzed or complexity of graphs that can be visually analyzed. These notebooks make it possible to consider simulations potentially involving millions of events (flips, rolls, etc.), book length bodies of text or highly complex graphs.

The Python notebooks are ready to use and donâ€™t require programming experience. Experiments, such as varying the number of coin flips or pages of text, can be done by changing a single parameter. On the other hand, users who have some programming experience may want to consider extending the functionality of the notebooks or even developing new notebooks from scratch.

While this content was originally developed for use by classrooms following the San Diego Unified School District high school discrete math curriculum, it can easily be adopted for use by anyone who wants to explore these topics.
